  The Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS) service is used to collect information on natural disasters, including earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, floods, volcanic eruptions, and droughts, as well as other types of disruptions such as those arising from geopolitical tensions. Disaster areas are then intersected with the ports and chokepoints databases to identify locations at risk of being disrupted.
